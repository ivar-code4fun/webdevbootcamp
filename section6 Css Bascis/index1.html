    <h1>Cuttlefish</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Cuttlefish or cuttles[2] are marine <a href="">molluscs</a> of the order Sepiida. They belong to the
        class Cephalopoda which also includes squid, octopuses, and nautiluses. Cuttlefish have
        a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone, which is used for control of buoyancy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cuttlefish eat small molluscs, crabs, shrimp, fish, octopus, worms, and other cuttlefish
        . Their predators include dolphins, sharks, fish, seals, seabirds, humans and other
        cuttlefish. The typical life expectancy of a cuttlefish is about 1â€“2 years. Studies are
        said to indicate cuttlefish to be among the most intelligent invertebrates.[4] Cuttlefish
        also have one of the largest brain-to-body size ratios of all invertebrates.

    <h2>Fossil record</h2>
    <p>The earliest fossils of cuttlefish are from the end of the Cretaceous period,[6][7]
        represented by Ceratisepia from the Late Maastrichtian Maastricht Formation of the
        Netherlands.[8] Although the Jurassic Trachyteuthis was historically considered possibly
        related to cuttlefish,[9] later studies considered to be more closely related to octopus
        and vampire squid.

    <h2>Anatomy and physiology</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Visual system</h3>
    <p>Cuttlefish, like other cephalopods, have sophisticated eyes. The organogenesis and the
        final structure of the cephalopod eye fundamentally differ from those of vertebrates
        such as humans.[15] Superficial similarities between cephalopod and vertebrate eyes
        are thought to be examples of convergent evolution. The cuttlefish pupil is a smoothly
        curving W-shape.[16][17] Although cuttlefish cannot see color,[18] they can perceive
        the polarization of light, which enhances their perception of contrast.

    <h3>Cuttlebone</h3>
    <p>
        Cuttlefish possess an internal structure called the cuttlebone, which is porous and is
        made of aragonite. The pores provide it with buoyancy, which the cuttlefish regulates
        by changing the gas-to-liquid ratio in the chambered cuttlebone via the ventral siphuncle.[23]
        Each species' cuttlebone has a distinct shape, size, and pattern of ridges or texture. The
        cuttlebone is unique to cuttlefish, and is one of the features that distinguish them from
        their squid relatives.
